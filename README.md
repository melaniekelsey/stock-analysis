# An Evaluation of Stocks for Future Investment
## Overview of the Project: A summary of Total Daily Voiume and Return % for Stocks in 2017-2018 to best determine which ones to make an investment

## Results

### Stock Performance over the years
In evaluating possible stocks for your parents' future investments, I felt it was important to look at multiple years of stock performance history. It was important to see both years because they give quite different snapshots of return and volume depending on the year. 

#### 2017 Results
2017 was a year with multiple stocks showing high returns of investment (3 with over 100%).  There was only one stock (TERP) that was showing a negative return of investment. 2017 seemed to be a lucrative time for Wall Street investors. I believe your parents were interested in investing in DQ. While 2017 showed them with almost 200% return of investment, 2018 was telling quite a different story.

#### 2018 Results
While in 2018, only 2 stocks actually provided a return in investment, despite the fact that there were higher daily volume overall for the evaluated stocks in that particular year. Both ENPH and RUN had a little over 80% return of investment, while all the others were in the red. Looking at DQ in 2018 you will see -62.6% return in investment.

#### Conclusion
In looking at that data, I don't feel confident that DQ is the right stock for your parents to invest in. Though 2017 was a great year for them, it seems like the stock might be a bit risky with the significant decline in returns in 2018. In looking at other possibilities, ENPH seems to be the winner. With a 2017 Return of 129.5% and a 2018 Return of 81.9%, it seems like a steady stock to invest in.
